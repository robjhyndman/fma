# Perceptual speed scores

Daily perceptual speed scores for a schizophrenic patient. The patient
began receiving a powerful tranquilizer (chlorpromzaine) on the 61st day
and continued receiving the drug for the remainder of the sample period.
It is expected that this drug would reduce perceptual speed.
